# Employee Management Console Project

This is a small training project in C# to practice **OOP concepts**.

## Features implemented:

- **Encapsulation** using private fields and public/internal properties.
- **Method Overloading** for handling different levels of address input.
- **Read-only Properties** (FullName).
- **Optional Parameters** in GetFullName method.
- **User Input Validation** using `TryParse`.

## How to Use:

1. Run the console application.
2. Enter the employee's first and last name.
3. Choose the address input type:
   - `1` - Enter City only
   - `2` - Enter City and District
   - `3` - Enter Full Address (City, District, Street)
4. Repeat for multiple employees by pressing 'y'.

## Notes:

- This project is for **learning purposes** and may be refactored in the future to improve design (e.g., creating a separate `Address` class).
